👋 Hi, I’m Keval Gothi

I’m an MCA student with a strong interest in software engineering and applied computer science.  
I enjoy building things close to the metal — code that actually *works*, scales, and makes sense.

💻 What I work with  
- JavaScript, Python, Java, C/C++  
- Web development (frontend + backend fundamentals)  
- Databases, APIs, and system-level concepts  
- Currently exploring app development, algorithms, and AI/ML foundations

📚 What I’m learning now  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (for real, not just LeetCode theatrics)  
- Software engineering principles and system design  
- Mobile and cloud-based application development

🤝 Open to  
- Collaborating on meaningful open-source projects  
- Learning-focused teams and serious side projects  
- Discussions that go deeper than “which framework is trending”
